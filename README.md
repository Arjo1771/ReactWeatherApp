I have create a weather app in react that use OpenWeather current weather, Geocoding, and forecast API to display weather.
Using the search component i am getting geographical coordinates latitude and longitude by typing the location name.
After typing the search inquiry the user gets a display of weather temperature description and weather details:feels like,wind and humidity inside flex box.Also the icon is displayed depending on the type of weather it is(cloudy,rainy,sunny etc.)
Below i am displaying 5 day weather forecast and when user clicks the icon that displays what sort of weather it is the user gets collapsable AccordionItemPanel 
where the user gets additional information:humidity,wind speed,pressure and rain precipitation.
